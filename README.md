# README.md Generator

## Description

This project required me to create a program to generate a README file within the terminal using node. Using the prompts after starting the application in the terminal, the user can fill in the questions with their information to produce a quality README file for their own application. Each README file created includes links that are clickable to take the user to specific sections of the README file. 

## Webpage
